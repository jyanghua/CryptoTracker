# ILoveZappos
Cryptocurrency price tracker and alerts created for an internship application at Zappos.
The project took approximately 2-3 days to complete as it was required to learn new libraries and use them for certain requirements.
Time was a constraint as it was done during Winter Quarter with other pending assignments and work during the week. 

MPAndroidChart, Retrofit, and RxJava/RxAndroid was used for the project.

Major requirements:

1. Transaction History
2. Order Book
3. Price Alert

More details will be included in the future.
